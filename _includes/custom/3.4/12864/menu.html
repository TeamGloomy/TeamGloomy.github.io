## Menu Files

Menu files must be uploaded to allow the display to generate the correct information. This can be done in two ways.
First, obtain the recommended menu files from [here](https://github.com/jadonmmiller/UltimateDuetMenuSystem/releases/)

### Method 1 - WiFi Mode only

Extract the contents of the zip file you downloaded above and place them in a folder called "Menu" on the SD card of the {{page.boardname}}. 

### Method 2

Activate the display using the config.g changes above.  
On the "System" tab, above the list of files, is a dropdown menu that defaults to "System Directory". Select this and change it to "Menu Directory".  

{% include image.html file="menu_folder.png" alt="Dropdown Menu" caption="Dropdown Menu" %}

Then upload the menu zip file.
