## Troubleshooting

If the screen is showing artifacts/random characters on the screen, the following may improve/eliminate the issue

* Lower the SPI frequency by half. This is the F value in M918.  
* Reduce the length of the cable between the screen and the board.  
* Ensure that the cable between the screen and the board is routed away from other cables, especially motor cables.  
* Add a ferrite ring to the cable between the screen and the board.
