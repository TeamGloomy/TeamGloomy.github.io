## Overview

This page covers how to reflash the bootloader on a {{page.boardname}}.  

### Tools

Unfortunately, it is not possible to enter DFU mode on this board through USB.  
This means that you will need an [ST-Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/st-link-v2/s?k=st+link+v2) to be able to reflash the bootloader. Fortunately these have been cloned by chinese manufacturers and can be picked up cheaply.  

### Software

These instructions cover flashing with Windows using the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) software. It is possible to use other software, such as DFU-Utils on linux, but they aren't covered here. You will have to register to be able to download the software.  

### Wiring

Connect the ST-Link to the {{page.boardname}} using 5 Jumpers. Connect the following:  

<div class="datatable-begin"></div>

|{{page.boardname}}|ST-Link|
|---|---|
|RST|RST|
|SWDIO|SWDIO|
|SWCLK|SWCLK|
|GND|GND|
|3.3v|3.3v|

<div class="datatable-end"></div>

### Process

Launch the STM32CubeProgrammer Software.  
Download the bootloader from [here]({{page.bootloaderURL}}).  
Select the correct connection method, in this instance its "stlink". You may need to click the refesh button to find it. Then click connect.

Then click on the "+" icon and find/open the bootloader file you downloaded earlier.

A "File Download Complete" popup will appear once complete.

Disconnect the board and continue flashing the firmware as normal.
