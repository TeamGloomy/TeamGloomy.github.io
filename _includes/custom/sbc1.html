## Overview

The {{page.boardname}} is a {{page.mcu}} based board.

{% include warning.html content="There have been a small number of users who have been suffering from random disconnects between the board and the SBC during printing. This has been due to the type of communication connection used by the DuetSoftwareFramework on the SBC to talk to the board being affected by electrical noise from either something on the printer or equipment near by. <br/> There are a number of steps that can be done to limit this issue.<br/>
1. Keep the wires between the controller and the Pi short <br/>
2. Use either a ribbon cable, or if using jumper wires then use ribbon-style jumper wire strips with the individual conductors separate only at the ends <br/>
3. Use multiple ground connections between the two<br/>
4. Beware of [ground loops](https://docs.duet3d.com/en/User_manual/Overview/USB_ground_loops). Problems are likely if more than one of the the PSU supplying the controller, the PSU supplying the Pi, and any other equipment that the Pi is connected to (other than via Ethernet) has its signal ground connected to the mains ground in the 3-pin plug that supplies the power. RPi PSUs are usually not grounded. ATX PSUs always are. Meanwell-style PSUs have a ground connection, but it is up to you whether you link mains ground to PSU negative output.<br/>
In short, these disconnects may happen to you or they may not. If they happen and you are unable to fix them, then the only remaining options are track down the noise by changing components one by one or switch to using WiFi rather than an SBC.<br/>
For STM32 based boards, there is little gain from using an SBC at this current time, especially as ESP32 is now available." %}

## Firmware File

Choose the correct corresponding firmware ({{page.firmware}}) from [here](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/releases){:target="_blank"}. Remember to rename it to firmware.bin. Put it in the root of a FAT32 formatted SD card. The maximum size supported card is 32GB.  

## SBC

Connecting a Single Board Computer, such as a raspberry pi 3B/3B+/4.

### Prepare the Raspberry Pi

Follow the instructions detailed [here](stm32_sbc.html){:target="_blank"}.

{% include tip.html content="If you want to use a board other than a Raspberry Pi, please follow the guide [here](dsf_on_armbian.html)"%}

### BOM

* 5 x 100R resistor
* jumpers or other ways of connecting to the {{page.boardname}}

### Connecting the SBC to the {{page.boardname}}
The pinout for the {{page.boardname}} can be found [here]({{page.schematic}}){:target="_blank"} and the schematic for the Duet 3 for reference can be found [here](https://github.com/Duet3D/Duet3-Mainboard-6HC/blob/master/Duet3_Mainboard_v1.0/Duet3_MB_schematic_v1.0.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The raspberry pi GPIO pinout can be found [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=raspberry+pi+gpio+pinout&rlz=1C1CHBD_en-GBGB889GB889&sxsrf=ALeKk01CVlA8N_CGAQqQGp-7_N3pXiV0LA:1586203613303&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid56X3zNToAhXSURUIHX3IAnkQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1920&bih=937){:target="_blank"}. 

The table below shows the pins required on the SBC and what they are connected to on the {{page.boardname}}. Please ensure that your cables are no longer than 30cm although they should ideally be as short as possible.

### Prepare the SD Card

All the SD card on the {{page.boardname}} needs is the board.txt file with the following contents.

```
//Config for {{page.boardname}}
board = {{page.board}}
sbc.TfrReadyPin = {{page.BCM25}}
{% if page.boardname == "Fly-407ZG" %}sbc.csPin = {{page.BCM8}}    {% endif %}
heat.tempSensePins = {{page.heat}}
{% if page.diagnostics != "" %}leds.diagnostic = {{page.diagnostics}}{% endif %}
```
