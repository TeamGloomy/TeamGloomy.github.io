## Overview

From 3.5b2, it is now possible to use one or two toolboards with an STM32F4 based board using the CAN-FD protocol. To do so, you must purchase a separate SPI to CAN-FD module. TeamGloomy have worked with Flymaker/Mellow to produce 2 designs of module to suit the board you are using.  

For the {{page.boardname}} we recommend the {{page.spiModule}} module, which can be purchased from [Aliexpress]({{page.moduleURL}}).
