## Physical Connections

Connect the BLTouch to the {{page.boardname}} as described in the table below.  

<div class="datatable-begin"></div>

|BLTouch Wire Colour|{{page.boardname}}|{{page.boardname}} Pin Name|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Brown|GND||
|Red|+5v||
|Yellow|{{page.yellowPin}}|{{page.yellowName}}|
|Black|GND||
|White|{{page.whitePin}}|{{page.whiteName}}|

{% capture imagefile %}
{{ page.image }}
{% endcapture %}
{% capture captiontext %}
{{ page.boardname }} BLTouch Connection
{% endcapture %}
{% if page.image != "" %}
{% include image.html file=imagefile alt="" caption=captiontext %}
{% endif %}

<div class="datatable-end"></div>

### Config.g Changes

Your config.g should be modified as below.
```
M558 P9 H6 F250:30 T8000 C"^124.{{page.whiteName}}"       ; set Z probe type to bltouch and the dive height + speeds
M950 S0 C"124.{{page.yellowName}}"                              ; Setup {{page.yellowName}} as servo port on {{page.boardname}}
```

You will also need to set up your probe offset using [G31](https://docs.duet3d.com/en/User_manual/Reference/Gcodes#g31-set-or-report-current-probe-status) and your [mesh probing grid](https://docs.duet3d.com/en/User_manual/Reference/Gcodes#m557-set-z-probe-point-or-define-probing-grid)

## Files to Create

Create the following files. 

{% include tip.html content="If you select the BLTouch while setting up your config.g files using the Configurator, these files should be created for you. We still advise checking them tho ensure the content is correct." %}

### deployprobe.g

Create a file in your sys folder called
```
deployprobe.g
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S10
```

### retractprobe.g

Create a file in your sys folder called
```
retractprobe.g
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S90
```

## Files to Modify

{% include tip.html content="If you select the BLTouch while setting up your config.g files using the Configurator, these files should be modified for you. We still advise checking them tho ensure the content is correct." %}

If you you want to use your probe as your z endstop, you need to modify your homeall.g/homedelta.g and homez.g

### homez.g

For homez.g, you will have need to have something similar to this. Please modify the co-ordinates required for the centre of your bed accordingly.
```
; ################# Home Z Preparation ################

G91 															; Relative mode
G1 H2 Z5 F5000													; Lower the bed
G90																; Back to absolute positioning
G1 X0 Y0 F10000 		 										; Move to the center of the bed. Adjust to the co-ordinates required for the centre of your bed

; ################# Home Z Preparation ################

G30					 											; Probe a single point
```

### homeall.g

The homeall.g should have something similar to the above or should call the homez.g file using
```
M98 P"homez.g"
```

## Testing Macros

It is suggested that you create a number of macros to allow testing of your BLTouch. These should each be created in the macros folder.  

### alarm release + pin

Create a file in your macros folder called
```
alarm release + pin
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S160 ; Alarm Release and Push-Pin UP
```

### pin up

Create a file in your macros folder called
```
pin up
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S90 ; Send PWM channel 0 the s90 (angle) command
```

### pin down

Create a file in your macros folder called
```
pin down
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S10 ; Send PWM channel 0 the S10 (angle) command
```

### selftest

Create a file in your macros folder called
```
self-test
```
In it, paste the following code
```
M280 P0 S120 ; Send PWM channel 7 the S10 (angle) command
```

## Marlin Fast Probe

There is a guide to replicating Marlins Fast Probe feature [here](https://forum.duet3d.com/topic/14544/guide-to-marlin-s-fast-bltouch-probing-feature-on-duet).

## Troubleshooting

### M280 works but the probe doesn't deploy using G30

Test that the probe deploys and retracts using `M401` and `M402` respectively.  
If they don't work then you either have the deployprobe.g and retractprobe.g in the wrong place (they need to be in **sys**) or the contents of those files are incorrect, in which case re-read this page.  

### M280 doesn't work

Either the wiring for the BLTouch is incorrect or the M950 servo definition is incorrect in config.g.  

### The probe doesn't self test on Startup

The wiring for the BLTouch is incorrect and should be checked.  

### The probe doesn't trigger

Either the wiring for the BLTouch is incorrect (swap the black and white cables) or the M558 definition is incorrect in config.g.
