## Using the SD card slot on the screen

It is possible to use the external SD card.  
To do so, add the following lines to your board.txt.  
If you do not have a board.txt file in sys (the same location as config.g), create one using DWC.  

```
sdCard.external.spiChannel={{page.spiChannel}}
sdCard.external.csPin=LCD_SS
sdCard.external.cardDetectPin=LCD_CD
```
