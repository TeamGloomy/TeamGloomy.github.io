## Manual board.txt Changes

If you are using a set of config files provided by someone else or have no need to use the configurator, you may need to create your board.txt file manually.
From 3.5-RC4, the majority of the board.txt configurables are pre-configured per board.   
The preset configurables for the {{page.boardname}} are listed below for reference.  

{% include {{page.rrfboot}} %}

{% if page.rrfbootOverrides == false %}
Unless you are overriding some of the above settings, or adding additional features, such as an accelerometer or 12864 display, a board.txt file is not required.  

### Sensorless Homing

Follow the instructions as found [here]({{page.sensorless}})

You can now continue getting the SD card in the correct format.
{% endif %}

{% if page.rrfbootOverrides == true %}
There should be no need to override any of the above preset values unless you are adding additional features, such as an accelerometer or 12864 display.  
You will however still need a board.txt file to configure, as a minimum, the drivers used in your board.
