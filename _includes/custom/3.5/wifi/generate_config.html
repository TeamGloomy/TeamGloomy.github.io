## Generate a config

We provide a handy [online tool](https://teamgloomy.github.io/Configurator) to assist you in generating a set of config files for your 3D printer. The configurator doesn't cover all options that RRF can be used for (such as dual motor axis control, which can be manually added later), however it does give a good start.  

We also have a collection of user created configs which can be a useful reference. They can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamGloomy/LPC-STM32-RRFUserConfigs)
