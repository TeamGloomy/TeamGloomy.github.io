## WiFi

You will need a BTT or MKS produced ESP8266 WiFi module or a [Fly/Mellow ESP32 Module](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oE7cB1k).  
TeamGloomy recommend an ESP32 module over an ESP8266 module as WiFi performance with an ESP32 is superior.

Make sure the jumpers are installed next to the WiFi headers as shown below.
