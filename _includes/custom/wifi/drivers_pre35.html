### Smart Drivers

If using TMC5160 or TMC22XX drivers (where 22XX is either the TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225 or TMC2226), the following line must also be added to the board.txt file
```
stepper.numSmartDrivers = X
```
Where X is the number of drivers fitted in total.

#### TMC5160 SPI Drivers

{% if page.boardname == "Fly-407ZG" %}
The Fly-407ZG is the only STM32 board that can't be used with 5160 drivers. This is due to them sharing the SPI pins used to also gain WiFi/SBC support.
{% endif %}
If using TMC5160 drivers, the following lines must also be added to the board.txt file.  
{% if page.stepperSPI == 0 or page.stepperSPI == 2 %}
```
stepper.num5160Drivers = X
stepper.spiChannel = {{page.stepperSPI}}
```
{% else %}
```
stepper.num5160Drivers = X
stepper.spiChannel = {{page.stepperSPI}}
SPI{{page.stepperSPI}}.pins = {{page.spiInfo}}
```
{% endif %}

Where X is the number of TMC5160 drivers fitted.

The drivers must be grouped together with the installed TMC5160s first. They can have gaps between each driver and/or driver type. So, if you have say 3 TMC5160s and 1 TMC22XX and 1 other driver, the 5160s should installed first (e.g. in slots 0, 1 and 2 or slots 0, 3 and 4), the TMC22XX in a slot after the 5160 and the remaining driver last. You can use RRF to assign any of those slots to an axis/extruder.

{% if page.boardname == "Fly-Super8Pro H723" or page.boardname == "Fly-Super8Pro H743" or page.boardname == "Fly-Super8" %}
{% include important.html content="Keep in mind the 3 first slots are powered through the 'Drive_Power High' terminals. This means if you use 48V and 24V drivers, make sure to not connect any 24V drivers on the 3 first slots."%}
{% endif %}
