## Overview

The PanelDue is the official screen produced by Duet3D for use with RepRapFirmware.  

A list of resellers can be found [here](https://www.duet3d.com/GenuineResellers).  

Documentation can be found [here](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/PanelDue).  

It should be wired to the TFT header (or AUX header on some boards) and information can be found on the "connecting a screen" page for each board where applicable.
