## Overview

The Troodon V2 Printer comes supplied with a bed levelling file for levelling the gantry to the bed. This is great except it only runs the levelling cycle once. This could result in the gantry not being as level to the bed as it could be. You could run G32 a number of times until the values converge but its much easier to let the firmware worth this out for itself.  
The bed.g file can be found on the system screen in DWC.  

### Default bed.g file

Below is the default bed file for reference.  
```
; bed.g
; called to perform automatic bed compensation via G32
;
; generated by RepRapFirmware Configuration Tool v3.2.3 on Sun Jun 13 2021 17:50:32 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
M561 ; clear any bed transform

M671 S20
G30 P2 X345 Y330 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P3 X345 Y12 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P0 X9 Y12 Z-99999
G30 P1 X9 Y330 Z-99999 S4 ; probe near a leadscrew and calibrate 4 motors
```

### Improved bed.g file

Copy the code below and replace the contents of the bed.g file.  
```
// bed.g take from the teamgloomy wiki
// version 1.0
if !move.axes[0].homed || !move.axes[1].homed	        ; If the printer hasn't been homed, home it
	G28 XY	; home y and x
G28 Z			                                        ; home z
M561							                        ; clear any bed transform
M671 S20
G30 P2 X345 Y330 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P3 X345 Y12 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P0 X9 Y12 Z-99999
G30 P1 X9 Y330 Z-99999 S4 ; probe near a leadscrew and calibrate 4 motors
echo "BTC: 1 - Difference was " ^ move.calibration.initial.deviation ^ "mm"
while move.calibration.initial.deviation >= 0.01		; perform additional tramming if previous deviation was over 0.01mm
  if iterations = 5
    abort "Too many auto tramming attempts"
  G30 P2 X345 Y330 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
  G30 P3 X345 Y12 Z-99999 ; probe near a leadscrew
  G30 P0 X9 Y12 Z-99999
  G30 P1 X9 Y330 Z-99999 S4 ; probe near a leadscrew and calibrate 4 motors
  echo "BTC: " ^ iterations + 2 ^ " - Difference was " ^ move.calibration.initial.deviation ^ "mm"
  continue
G28 Z							                        ; home z
```
This will repeat the gantry levelling routine until the deviation between all 4 points is less than 0.01mm or the bed has been probed 5 times.
