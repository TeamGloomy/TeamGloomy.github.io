## Overview

These instructions enhance the instructions provided by Formbot with the Troodon V2 Printer and are designed to be a replacement.  

### Tools

Most of the tools that are required to assemble the printer have been provided, however, the following tools will be required.

* Scissors
* 5.5mm Spanner/Adjustable Spanner/Pliers/5.5mm Socket
* Syringe with blunt tipped needle (size 16G and 18G needles required).
* Loctite

The following printable tools could assist with the assembly process

* [MGN9 assembly tool](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap/blob/main/STLs/MGN9_Assembly_Tool.stl)  

### Pre-requisits

These instructions begin with the assumption that you have removed all the items from the box.  

First, place this piece of packing foam on the surface you are going to build on.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_foam.jpg" alt="Protective Foam" caption="Protective Foam" %}
Place the base upside down on this foam and remove the electronics bay cover.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_electronics_bay.jpg" alt="Electronics Bay" caption="Electronics Bay" %}
Check all the electrical connections are secure and nothing is loose.  
Replace the electronics bay cover.  

All of the linear rails supplied with the printer are not lubricated and therefore require lubrication.  
Fill a syringe with the grease provided with the Troodon V2.  
Use a 16G blunt tipped needle for the MGN9 Rails and an 18G blunt tipped needle for the MGN12 Rail.  
Please see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWzz6fQiWmw) for further instruction.

### Frame Assembly

Rather than just loosening the screws as instructed in the manual, using a 3mm allen key, remove each of the screws, apply loctite and reinstall them, with the suggested gap.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_1.png" alt="Z Extrusion Screws" caption="Z Extrusion Screws" %}
Install the Z extrusion as shown in the image below. Ensure the extrusions are flush against the metal sheet on the bottom of the printer. Tighten each of the screws until they are just gripping the extrusion to allow the extrusion to be pulled into position. Then fully tighten each screw.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_2.png" alt="Z Extrusion Install" caption="Z Extrusion Install" %}
Repeat for all for Z extrusions.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_3.png" alt="all Z Extrusions Install" caption="all Z Extrusions Install" %}
Mount the top plate to the printer, ensuring the LED is at the back of the printer and the door magnets are on the front. Use loctite on the screws when installing them.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_4.png" alt="Top Plate Install" caption="Top Plate Install" %}
Install the feet to the bottom of the printer.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_5.png" alt="Feet Install" caption="Feet Install" %}
Loosely mount the idler pulleys. The screws should just protrude from the threaded hole in the brackets.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_6.png" alt="Idler Pulley Install" caption="Idler Pulley Install" %}
Inspect the toolhead and make sure all the cable ties are installed and the heat cables are not dangling below the nozzle.  
Place a piece of foam onto the build platform.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_7.png" alt="Foam Protection" caption="Foam Protection" %}
Lift in the gantry, at an angle, into the machine.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_8.png" alt="Gantry Install" caption="Gantry Install" %}
Place the gantry on the foam.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_9.png" alt="Gantry Install" caption="Gantry Install" %}
Hook the pre formed loop of the z belt on to the hook on the underside of the gantry.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_10.png" alt="Gantry Lower Belt Loop" caption="Gantry Lower Belt Loop" %}
Pass the other end of belt through the sheet metals.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_11.png" alt="Gantry Belt Passthrough" caption="Gantry Belt Passthrough" %}
Pass belt through the top idler pulley.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_12.png" alt="Gantry Belt Over Idler" caption="Gantry Belt Over Idler" %}
Install a buckle onto the belt with the treaded hole on the side with teeth.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_13.png" alt="Gantry Belt Buckle Install" caption="Gantry Belt Buckle Install" %}
Pulling the belt taught, form a loop at the end of the belt. You want the loop to be positioned so it can just be hooked over the hook on the top of the gantry and doesn't result in a belt that is too slack. Lifting the gantry slightly can aid in this process.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_14.png" alt="Gantry Upper Belt Loop" caption="Gantry Upper Belt Loop" %}
Slide the buckle over the looped up belt so it is about 15mm from the end. Apply loctite to the grub screw and install it using a 2mm allen key.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_15.png" alt="Gantry Final Buckle Install" caption="Gantry Final Buckle Install" %}
Hook the belt onto the hook on the top of the gantry.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_16.png" alt="Gantry Upper Belt Loop Install" caption="Gantry Upper Belt Loop Install" %}
Repeat for all 4 corners.  
{% include tip.html content="Ensure the cabling at the back right corner passes behind the belt as shown below." %}
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_cable_route.jpg" alt="X Cable Behind Z Belt" caption="X Cable Behind Z Belt" %}
Rotate the screw holes of four movable hinges to the centre.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_17.png" alt="Prepare Gantry Hinges" caption="Prepare Gantry Hinges" %}
Install the  M5x35 screw and spring washer. The screw should be aligned with the threaded hole of movable hinge. Fully tighten the screw. Install all four movable hinges in the same way.  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_18.png" alt="Attach Z Carriages to Gantry" caption="Attach Z Carriages to Gantry" %}
If itâ€™s difficult to align the screws with the threaded holes on movable hinges, please loosen four M4 screws at the back of gantry for adjustment. Tighten back these M4 screws once all four holes are aligned.
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_19.png" alt="Loosen if Required" caption="Loosen if Required" %}
Now it is time to tighten the Z axis belts. Adjust the belts to 140Hz as described [here](https://docs.vorondesign.com/tuning/secondary_printer_tuning.html#belt-tension)  
{% include image.html file="troodon_v2_assembly_20.png" alt="Tension Z Belts" caption="Tension Z Belts" %}
{% include tip.html content="While tightening the belts, check they sit correctly in the upper and lower pulleys." %}
{% include important.html content="This is also the time to adjust the A/B belt tensions as described in the link above. A number of users have reported that the belts on their machines had a much higher tension than recommended." %}
Remove the foam from on top of the build plate.
