## Overview

The Fly-Super8Pro H743 does not come with an RRF compatible bootloader, so this page covers how to flash one.

### Prerequisits

You need to download the following items to be able to update the bootloader.  

* [STM32CubeProg](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
{% if {{site.latestStableFirmware}} == {{site.latestBetaFirmware}} %}
* [RRF Bootloader]({{site.latestStableFirmware}}/bootloader){:target="_blank"}
{% else %}
The latest stable firmware files can be found [here]({{site.latestStableFirmware}}){:target="_blank"}  
And the latest unstable firmware files can be found [here]({{site.latestBetaFirmware}}){:target="_blank"}
{% endif %}
* [RRF Bootloader](https://github.com/gloomyandy/IAP/releases)

Once you have downloaded STM32CubeProg, install it using the default options.

### Flashing the bootloader

Install a jumper in the position shown below. This places the board in DFU mode to allow the bootloader to be flashed.
