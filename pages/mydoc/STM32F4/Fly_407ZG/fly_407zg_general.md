### Driver Jumpers

The jumpers should be installed as below. "Common Interpolation" should be used for standalone drivers. "SPI mode Interpolation" is not a currently supported configuration as this port does not support SPI communication to drivers. "UART mode Interpolation" should be used when using smart drivers (i.e. TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225 and TMC2226)

### Input voltage

The board can handle an input voltage up to 32v.

### Initial Installation

The board that you will receive doesn't have any firmware installed so when plugged into a computer, the board will show as an unidentified device.
Follow the [ESP8266 WiFi instructions](fly_407zg_connected_wifi_8266.html), [ESP32 WiFi instructions](fly_407zg_connected_wifi_32.html) or the [SBC instructions](fly_407zg_connected_sbc.html) for what to do next.

## Issues

Some boards shipped are missing the bootloader.  
If your board has the Mellow logo on the back and when you place a firmware.bin file on the SD card and it doesn;t get converted, then yours is one of these boards.  
Follow the below steps to rectify this issue.  

1. Download and install the STM32 software from [here](https://www.stmicroelectronics.com.cn/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html).  
2. Add two jumpers to the fly board as shown below.
