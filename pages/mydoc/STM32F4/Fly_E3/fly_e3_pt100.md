## Overview

Some Fly-E3 boards have support for PT100 and type 'K' thermocouples. If your board has the two chips in the red square populated then you are good to go.  This is only applicable from 3.2_7.

## Board.txt modifications

The following lines should be added to the board.txt file.

```text
SPI3.pins = { PC_2, PC_0, PC_1 }
heat.spiTempSensorChannel = 3
heat.spiTempSensorCSPins = { PC_3, PC_7 }
```

## Config.g changes

### PT100

To use the PT100 on your hotend, use the following code in config.g
If you are in a country where the mains frequency is 50Hz, change the F60 to F50 (if you don't know, look [here](https://www.oaktreeproducts.com/img/product/description/List%20of%20Worldwide%20AC%20Voltages.pdf))

```

{% include warning.html content="Make sure you include the R430 as the Fly-E3 uses a different reference resistor than expected" %}

### Type 'K' Thermocouple

To use the Type 'K' Thermocouple on your hotend, use the following code in config.g

```text
M308 S1 P"PC_7" Y"thermocouple-max6675"
```
