## Overview

Some Fly-E3-Pro-v3 boards have support for PT100 and type 'K' thermocouples.  
If your board has the chip shown below in red, you have PT100 support.

If your board has the chip shown below in red, you have 'K' type thermocouple support.

## Board.txt modifications

The following lines should be added to the board.txt file.

```text
SPI3.pins = { PD_14, PD_12, PD_13 }
heat.spiTempSensorChannel = 3
heat.spiTempSensorCSPins = { PD_15, PC_7 }
```

## Config.g changes

### PT100

{% include important.html content="The Fly-E3-Pro-v3 is designed to work with 3 wire PT100 temperature sensors rather than the typical 2 wire ones." %}

A 2 wire PT100 can be converted to a 3 wire PT100. Ideally, all wires going to the PT100 should be of the same type and length to ensure they're all the same resistance. Cut the wires of the PT100 close (around 50 - 100mm) to the sensor. Then attach 1 wire to 1 wire of the sensor and attach the other 2 wires to the other wire of the sensor.

{% include image.html file="3_wire_PT100.png" alt="3 Wire PT100" caption="3 wire PT100" %}  

Connect the two wires to connectors 1 and 2 and connect the single wire to connector 3.

To use the PT100 on your hotend, use the following code in config.g
If you are in a country where the mains frequency is 50Hz, change the F60 to F50 (if you don't know, look [here](https://www.oaktreeproducts.com/img/product/description/List%20of%20Worldwide%20AC%20Voltages.pdf))

```

{% include warning.html content="Make sure you include the R430 as the Fly-E3-Pro-v3 uses a different reference resistor than expected" %}

### Type 'K' Thermocouple

To use the Type 'K' Thermocouple on your hotend, use the following code in config.g

```text
M308 S1 P"PC_7" Y"thermocouple-max31855"
```
