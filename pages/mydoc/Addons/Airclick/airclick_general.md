## Overview

This page covers any general information for the {{page.name}}.  
It is currently available through [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oFdvJAp).  

### Features

The {{page.name}} is a high compatability device which allows as many wireless buttons as you wish to be connected to control your printer.  
The connection between the {{page.name}} is done wirelessly using an ESP32 (which means it has to connect to a 2.4GHz network) and the buttons connect using RF 433MHz.  

{% include important.html content="As the buttons work over RF 433MHz, you can only press one button at a time" %}
